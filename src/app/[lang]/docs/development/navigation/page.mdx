# Navigation

The navigation structure of the application is defined in the `src/data/navigation.ts` file. This file allows you to configure and customize the navigation according to the specific needs of your project.

## Overview

The `navigationsData` constant contains an array of navigation sections (or root items). Each section defines a set of related navigation items. By editing this structure, you can customize which links and sections appear in the app's navigation menu.

## File Structure

The structure of the navigation data is based on the following format:

```typescript
const navigationsData: NavigationType[] = [
  {
    title: "Section Title", // The title of the navigation section (e.g., "Dashboards")
    items: [
      {
        title: "Item Title", // The title of the navigation item
        href: "/some/path", // or "items" for nested items
        iconName: "IconName", // Name of the Lucide icon associated with the item
        label: "Optional Label", // Optional label (e.g., "New", "Soon")
        items: [
          // For nested items
          {
            title: "Nested Item",
            href: "/nested/path",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### How to Modify the Navigation

#### **Add a New Navigation Section (Root Item)**

To add a new section (root item) in the navigation, simply append a new object to the `navigationsData` array. The new section should include the `title` property for the section name and an `items` array that holds the section's individual navigation items.

Example: Add a "Support" root item:

```typescript
export const navigationsData: NavigationType[] = [
  {
    title: "Support",
    items: [],
  },
];
```

This will add a new "Support" section to the navigation menu.

#### **Add a New Navigation Item**

To add a new item under an existing navigation section (root item), simply insert a new object into the `items` array of the corresponding section. Each navigation item should contain an `href` or `items` field (to support nested items).
Note: If the corresponding item is the root item make sure to add iconName otherwize it should not be included.

Note: Item must contain either **href** or **items**.

Example: Add a "Dashboard" item under the "Dashboards" root item:

```typescript
export const navigationsData: NavigationType[] = [
  {
    title: "Dashboards",
    items: [
      {
        title: "Dashboard",
        href: "/dashboard",
        iconName: "ChartPie",
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

#### **Add a Nested Navigation Item**

To add a nested item within an existing navigation item (e.g., a submenu), simply insert the new item into the `items` array of the target item. This is useful for creating submenus or hierarchical navigation.

Example: Add a "Settings" item under the "Dashboard" item:

```typescript
export const navigationsData: NavigationType[] = [
  {
    title: "Dashboards",
    items: [
      {
        title: "Dashboard",
        iconName: "ChartPie",
        items: [
          {
            title: "Settings",
            href: "/dashboard/settings",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### **Important Notes:**

1. **Icon Names**: Each root navigation section (root item) requires an `iconName` property, but nested items (submenus) do not need it.
2. **Item Structure**: Each item must contain either an `href` (a link) or an `items` array (for nested items). If an item contains `items`, it is treated as a parent item and will appear as a collapsible section in the navigation.

By following this structure and these guidelines, you can easily customize and extend the navigation for your application.
