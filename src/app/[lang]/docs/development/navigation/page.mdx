## Customizing the Navigation Data

The `src/data/navigation.ts` file contains the navigation structure for the application. This file defines groups of navigation items, such as dashboards, pages, apps, and authentication links.

To customize the navigation, you can add new navigation items or modify existing ones according to your project's requirements.

### File Structure

The `navigationsData` constant holds an array of navigation groups. Each group contains an array of items with the following properties:

- **title**: The name of the navigation group (e.g., "Dashboards", "Pages").
- **items**: A list of navigation items within that group.
  - **title**: The name of the navigation item.
  - **href**: The URL path for the navigation item.
  - **iconName**: The name of the icon associated with the navigation item (e.g., "ChartPie", "User").
  - **label**: Optional label for items (e.g., "Soon" or "New").

### Example: Default Navigation Structure

```typescript
import type { NavigationGroupType } from "@/types";

export const navigationsData: NavigationGroupType[] = [
  {
    title: "Dashboards",
    items: [
      {
        title: "Analytics",
        href: "/dashboards/analytics",
        iconName: "ChartPie",
      },
      {
        title: "CRM",
        href: "/dashboards/crm",
        iconName: "ChartBar",
      },
      {
        title: "eCommerce",
        href: "/dashboards/ecommerce",

    items: [

      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### How to Modify the Navigation

#### **Add a New Navigation Item**

To add a new item to any navigation group, simply insert a new object into the `items` array of the corresponding group.

Example: Add a "Dashboard" item under the "Dashboards" group:

```typescript
{
  title: "Dashboard",
  href: "/dashboards/dashboard",
  iconName: "Home",
}
```

#### **Add a New Navigation Group**

To create a new navigation group, simply add a new object to the `navigationsData` array. This object should have a `title` property for the group name, and an `items` array that contains the group's navigation items.

Example: Add a "Support" group with related items:

```typescript
{
  title: "Support",
  items: [
    {
      title: "Help Center",
      href: "/support/help-center",
      iconName: "Headset",
    },
    {
      title: "Contact Us",
      href: "/support/contact",
      iconName: "Mail",
    },
  ],
}
```

This will create a new "Support" section in the navigation with the listed items.
